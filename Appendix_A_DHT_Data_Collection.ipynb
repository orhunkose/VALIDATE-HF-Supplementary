    "## A.1 Practical Considerations\n",
    "Standard practices for actigraphy measurements are as important as the reliability assessment itself. To collect accurate and reliable data for actigraphy measurements, researchers should consider cohort limitations (e.g., physical limitations), DHT placement, and the duration of measurement. Validation of actigraphy DHTs may require manual measurement (e.g., 6MWD or step count) or other validated DHTs (sleep quality or activity rate). The first step in validation is ensuring consistency in the measurement setting and data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling actigraphy data must report the sampling rate of both the unvalidated DHT and the gold standard to avoid aliasing or undersampling during feature extraction. Inter‑rater/intra‑rater variability and environment (time of day, location) are common sources of error. Robust preprocessing and outlier handling reduce rater‑based errors and clarify device reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example note: For a given device, changing sampling from 30 Hz to 100 Hz can bias activity counts by **~1,000–3,000 counts/min** (>10% difference), underscoring the need to report sampling configurations.\n"

    "## A.2 The Difference Between Agreement and Correlation\n",
    "Correlation measures the strength of the linear relationship, while **agreement** measures how closely two methods match **on the same scale**. Variables can be perfectly correlated yet not agree if they differ by scale or offset (e.g., °C vs °F or °C vs K). Thus, a high correlation (e.g., ρ close to 1) is insufficient to prove accuracy. Agreement metrics (e.g., CCC, BA with bias and LoA compared to MCID) are needed when validating a DHT against a gold standard (e.g., smartwatch vs manual 6MWD).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Illustrative idea**: Plot °C vs °F and °C vs K alongside a 45° line (perfect agreement) to show perfect correlation but poor agreement due to offset/scale.\n"

With decentralized clinical trials (DCTs), DHTs can expand access and reduce burden but must still meet regulatory and ethical standards (design, recruitment, monitoring, data integrity)."
